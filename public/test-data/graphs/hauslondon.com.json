Momentum is now growing to celebrate, reclaim and preserve buildings which were once written off or allowed to decay. This collection of unique and evocative photography by Simon Phipps casts the city in a new light. Arranged by inner London Borough, Brutal London takes in famous examples such as the Trellick Tower, the Brunswick Centre and the Alexandra Road Estate, as well as lesser known housing and municipal spaces. It serves as an introduction to buildings the reader may see every day, an invitation to look differently, a challenge to look up afresh, or to seek out celebrated Brutalism across the capital. </p>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p><strong>Dimensions</strong><br />20 x 15 cm, 198pp </p>","published_at":"2016-12-09T11:38:00+00:00","weights":"'-3':11C '1':10C 'accessori':12B 'book':3A 'brutal':1A 'lead':8C 'lead-tim':7C 'london':2A 'phipp':6A 'simon':5A 'time':9C"}},"9e475c44-1f66-40d9-8ac2-7747e3307982":{"e":[{"t":"144c3e12-860d-4f10-adbf-b09601e1b11d","d":1,"y":"A"},{"t":"780312c3-962d-480f-8fcc-e955141e5f73","d":1,"y":"B"},{"t":"c0a0d394-9396-4881-93ef-5e3f6cb59488","d":1,"y":"D"},{"t":"6cea4cdc-cc4c-4836-b0e8-db14912ae979","d":1,"y":"D"}],"l":"Wise Monkey Print - Pierre Charpin","x":"D","f":{"handle":"wise-monkey-print-by-pierre-charpin","body_sanitized":"A limited edition of four new framed prints by celebrated designer Pierre Charpin.

The Radiohus Pendant has since become a cherished design icon across the world. <br /><br />Louis Poulsen is relaunching the beautiful Radiohus pendant in two sizes: Ø25 cm and Ø37 cm. The Radiohus Pendant consists of three layers of mouth-blown glass. The innermost and outermost layers are made of transparent polished glass, while white glass is used for the intermediate layer. The VL45 Radiohus Pendant has been updated from the perspectives of lighting technology and energy efficiency.</p>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p><b>Materials</b><br />Shade in mouth-blown glossy white opal glass and pendant tube in brushed brass.<br /><br /><b>Dimensions<br /></b>Ø17.5 - Diameter 17.5 cm x Height 24.6 cm<br />Ø25 - Diameter 25 cm x Height 32.8 cm<br />Ø37 - Diameter 37 cm x Height 44.8 cm<br />Cable length 4.4m<br /><br /><strong>Light Source<br /></strong>Ø17.5 - E27 Max 100W<strong><br /></strong>Ø25 - E27 Max 100W<br />Ø37 - E27 Max 200W</p>","published_at":"2016-11-15T11:51:00+00:00","weights":"'-4':12C '3':11C 'lead':9C 'lead-tim':8C 'light':4A,13B 'loui':6A 'pendant':3A 'poulsen':7A 'radiohus':2A 'time':10C 'vl45':1A"}},"877975a4-7bf5-478b-9dcd-7d8bb05839cb":{"e":[{"t":"6585dcb8-dab1-44cb-9b56-ff0b9993f617","d":1,"y":"A"},{"t":"da0153b3-abe1-41bc-8e8b-1255a16c59ef","d":1,"y":"B"},{"t":"4d0ff647-c933-47d1-9f28-4683416df7d4","d":1,"y":"D"},{"t":"4c3c20dc-76d1-47eb-941c-251c7b26470a","d":1,"y":"D"}],"l":"Suspence Pendant Light by Lightyears","x":"D","f":{"handle":"suspence-pendant-light-by-gamfratesi","body_sanitized":"GamFratesi's inspiration for the Suspence lamp has been translating a movement into a physical shape.

The clear structure of the all aluminium chair consists of two parts. First, a pair of U-shaped profiles connected by welded crossbeams form a self-supporting frame and simultaneously serve as the legs and low armrests. This base supports a seat shell, which makes ideal use of the material’s possibilities: the punched holes not only ensure the modest weight and flexibility of the comfortable shell, but also give the graceful Landi its trademark appearance.</p>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p><strong>Materials</strong><br />Seat shell: pressed aluminium with 91 punched holes, matte anodised surface.<br />Base: armrests and legs from bent aluminium profiles with welded aluminium cross braces.</p>\n<p>Glides in light grey injection moulded TPE.<br />Suitable for outdoor use.</p>\n<p><b>Dimensions</b><br />Width 515mm x Depth 650mm x Height 795mm<br />Seat height 475mm<br />Armrest height 585mm</p>","published_at":"2016-06-17T11:54:00+01:00","weights":"'6':8C 'chair':2A 'furnitur':9B 'landi':1A 'lead':6C 'lead-tim':5C 'time':7C 'vitra':4A"}},"a9b8367b-cbc7-4287-88f2-cffb05b58fea":{"e":[{"t":"5436958e-7d62-4989-b8fc-0f55c5bdf688","d":1,"y":"A"},{"t":"89e27468-a4dd-4c16-863e-5fb807bfd072","d":1,"y":"B"},{"t":"1c2774c9-01a1-4467-8f8b-92af0b065ff3","d":1,"y":"D"},{"t":"05ff6d6f-f8e3-445e-9ccb-1514821559c0","d":1,"y":"D"}],"l":"A Table by Vitra","x":"D","f":{"handle":"a-table-by-maarten-van-severen","body_sanitized":"<p>The A-Table is one of the puristic designs that brought Maarten Van Severen to fame and became his trademark.

Cirque pendant light was inspired by a trip to Tivoli in Copenhagen. Tivoli is full of whirls and twirls – carousels, candyfloss makers and wheels of fortune. When an object spins around very fast, the colours merge and end up being perceived as horizontal bands of colour. All these impressions resulted in a vibrant design which unites unconventional colours and forms in a series of truly innovative lamps which will add both edge and charisma to their surroundings. <br /><br />The Cirque series is equally suited for restaurants, bars, kitchens, dining rooms and bedrooms. A diffuse downward light is reflected from the matt white inside of the lamp, which is glare-free when hung at normal height.</p>\n<h3>Details</h3>\n<p>Available in three colour combinations and in three sizes: Ø15 cm, Ø22 cm and Ø38 cm. <br /><br />Colour combinations:</p>\n<p>A - yellow (top), grey, white, copper<br />B - coral (top) , grey, green, yellow<br />C - copper (top) , white, grey, green</p>\n<p><b>Materials</b><br />Spun aluminium shade<br /><br /><b>Dimensions<br /></b>Small - Diameter 15 cm x Height 19 cm<br />Medium - Diameter 22 cm x Height 29.5 cm<br />Large - Diameter 38 cm x Height 47.8 cm<br />Cable length 3m<br /><br /><strong>Light Source<br /></strong>E27 small 25W, medium 60W, large 100W.</p>","published_at":"2016-04-26T13:11:00+01:00","weights":"'-4':11C '3':10C 'cirqu':1A 'lead':8C 'lead-tim':7C 'light':3A,12B 'loui':5A 'pendant':2A 'poulsen':6A 'time':9C"}},"ecd0f9b6-6b1f-49fa-b1a4-3dccb768964f":{"e":[{"t":"703866e1-c878-4e92-8474-eaf259d82214","d":1,"y":"A"},{"t":"da0153b3-abe1-41bc-8e8b-1255a16c59ef","d":1,"y":"B"},{"t":"4c3c20dc-76d1-47eb-941c-251c7b26470a","d":1,"y":"D"}],"l":"Annular Pendant by M-S-D-S","x":"D","f":{"handle":"annular-pendant-by-m-s-d-s","body_sanitized":"<p>The Annular pendant pairs a conical shade with a perfect ring of light at the fixture’s perimeter.
